# sqlalchemy-challenge

For this week's challenge it was decided that it has been too long since a vacation has been planned, it was also determined
that there are not two any better partners for this predicament than our old friends SQL and Python. 

The goal of this week's challenge was to access a SQLlite database using SQLAlchemy via Python to manipulate data and then use
similar techniques to create a flask app and use the terminal and web browser to display pertinent data and also add an interactive 
element using dates within a given range to display minimum, average and max temperatures.
